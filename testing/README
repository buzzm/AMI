You will compare two SPARQL statements.  The first statement is ALWAYS the
"target SPARQL" and the second is the "AMI SPARQL."  Your goal is
to determine how much different the "AMI SPARQL" is from the target.
Here now are the target and AMI SPARQL responses, separated by four dashes:

%s
----
%s

You are to compare the two statements and categorize the comparison in
a score as follows:
 *  "1" means exact match, although this is a rarity.
 *  "2" means the SPARQL logic and the number of types output are the same but
    potentially with different variable names
 *  "3" means the SPARQL logic is the same but a different number of output
    variables
 *  "4" means the SPARQL logic is "mildly" not the same, most likely in terms
    of different properties being examined.
 *  "5" means the SPARQL logic is "definitely" not the same.  An example of
    this is if statement #1 performs a one-or-more path walk
    (e.g. `ami:linksWith+`) and statement #2 does not.
You MUST provide narrative and explanations to support your
categorization decision.
You MUST make the output response of category and narrative in JSON so that
a consumer can easily digest the response.
Please perform the comparison and categorization now.
